### ADCP Docker

This is a Dockerfile which I used to build the Autodock Crankpep (ADCP) software. The software is somewhat deprecated and difficult to install on modern systems, not least because it isn't Python 3 compatible. This Docker container can be run interactively using data files on mounted volumes
